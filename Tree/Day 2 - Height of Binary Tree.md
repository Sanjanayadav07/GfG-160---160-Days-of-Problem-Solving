# üöÄ _Day 2. Height of Binary Tree_ üß†

The problem can be found at the following link: [Problem Link](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/batch/gfg-160-problems/track/tree-gfg-160/problem/height-of-binary-tree)

## üí° **Problem Description:**

Given a binary tree, find its height.  
The height of a tree is defined as the number of edges on the longest path from the root to a leaf node.  
A leaf node is a node that does not have any children.

## üîç **Example Walkthrough:**

**Example 1:**  
**Input:**  
`root[] = [12, 8, 18, 5, 11]`

<img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c29ca866-64ae-48b1-ad74-05d29ad7c1f0" width="30%">

**Output:**  
`2`  
**Explanation:**  
One of the longest paths from the root (node 12) goes through node 8 to node 5, which has 2 edges.

**Example 2:**  
**Input:**  
`root[] = [1, 2, 3, 4, N, N, 5, N, N, 6, 7]`

<img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9f828753-bfae-4306-9d86-6d129cb37ef4" width="30%">

**Output:**  
`3`  
**Explanation:**  
The longest path from the root (node 1) to a leaf node (node 6) contains 3 edges.

**Constraints:**

- 1 <= number of nodes <= $10^5$
- 0 <= node->data <= $10^5$

## üéØ **My Approach:**

We can solve the problem using recursion by computing the height of the left and right subtrees and taking the maximum of the two.

- **Recursive DFS (Top-Down):**  
  Traverse the tree and for each node, return `1 + max(height(left), height(right))`.
- **Iterative BFS (Level Order):**  
  Use a queue to## 
 perform level order traversal and count the number of levels.

## üïí **Time and Auxiliary Space Complexity**

- **Expected Time Complexity:** O(N), as each node is visited exactly once.
- **Expected Auxiliary Space Complexity:** O(H), where H is the height of the tree (space used in the recursion stack).

## üìù **Solution Code**

## Code (Java)

```java
class Solution {
    int height(Node node){
        return node == null ? -1 : 1 + Math.max(height(node.left), height(node.right));
    }
}
```
