#  _Day 5. K-th element of two Arrays_ 


The problem can be found at the following link: [Question Link](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/batch/gfg-160-problems/track/searching-gfg-160/problem/k-th-element-of-two-sorted-array1317)

## üí° **Problem Description:**

Given two sorted arrays `a[]` and `b[]`, along with an integer `k`, the task is to find the element that would appear at the k-th position in the combined sorted array of `a[]` and `b[]`.

## üîç **Example Walkthrough:**

Input:  
```
a[] = [2, 3, 6, 7, 9], b[] = [1, 4, 8, 10], k = 5
```
Output:  
```
6
```
Explanation: The combined sorted array would be `[1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]`. The 5th element is `6`.

Input:  
```
a[] = [100, 112, 256, 349, 770], b[] = [72, 86, 113, 119, 265, 445, 892], k = 7
```
Output:  
```
256
```
Explanation: The combined sorted array is `[72, 86, 100, 112, 113, 119, 256, 265, 349, 445, 770, 892]`. The 7th element is `256`.

**Constraints:**
- $\( 1 \leq \text{size of } a, b \leq 10^6 \)$
- $\( 1 \leq k \leq \text{size of } a + \text{size of } b \)$
- $\( 0 \leq a[i], b[i] < 10^8 \)$



## üéØ **My Approach:**

1. **Binary Search on Cuts:**
   - The problem can be viewed as finding the correct "cut point" in the arrays `a[]` and `b[]` such that the k-th element lies at the boundary between the left and right halves of the merged arrays.
   - Use binary search to adjust the cut point in `a[]`, and calculate the corresponding cut point in `b[]`.

2. **Key Observations:**
   - The left part of the combined array must consist of the largest `k` elements from `a[]` and `b[]` combined.
   - For the cut to be valid:
     - The largest element on the left part of `a[]` (cut1) should be ‚â§ the smallest element on the right part of `b[]` (cut2).
     - Similarly, the largest element on the left part of `b[]` (cut2) should be ‚â§ the smallest element on the right part of `a[]` (cut1).

3. **Binary Search Implementation:**
   - Perform binary search on `a[]`'s possible cut points while ensuring the constraints for valid cuts are satisfied.
   - Return the maximum of the largest elements from both left parts once a valid cut is found.

## üïí **Time and Auxiliary Space Complexity** 

- **Expected Time Complexity:** O(log(min(a, b))), as the binary search is performed on the smaller array.
- **Expected Auxiliary Space Complexity:** O(1), as we use only a constant amount of additional space.

## üìù **Solution Code**

## Code (Java)

```java
class Solution {
    public int kthElement(int[] a, int[] b, int k) {
        if (a.length > b.length) return kthElement(b, a, k);

        int n = a.length, m = b.length, low = Math.max(0, k - m), high = Math.min(k, n);

        while (low <= high) {
            int cut1 = (low + high) / 2;
            int cut2 = k - cut1;

            int l1 = (cut1 > 0) ? a[cut1 - 1] : Integer.MIN_VALUE;
            int l2 = (cut2 > 0) ? b[cut2 - 1] : Integer.MIN_VALUE;
            int r1 = (cut1 < n) ? a[cut1] : Integer.MAX_VALUE;
            int r2 = (cut2 < m) ? b[cut2] : Integer.MAX_VALUE;

            if (l1 <= r2 && l2 <= r1) {
                return Math.max(l1, l2);
            } else if (l1 > r2) {
                high = cut1 - 1;
            } else {
                low = cut1 + 1;
            }
        }

        return -1;
    }
}
```
