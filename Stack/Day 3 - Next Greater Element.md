#  _Day 3. Next Greater Element_ 

The problem can be found at the following link: [Question Link](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/batch/gfg-160-problems/track/stack-gfg-160/problem/next-larger-element-1587115620)

## üí° **Problem Description:**

Given an array `arr[]` of integers, the task is to find the **next greater element** for each element of the array in order of their appearance in the array.  
The **next greater element** of an element in the array is the **nearest element on the right** which is **greater than the current element**.

If there does not exist a next greater element for the current element, then **next greater element** is **-1**.  
For example, the next greater element of the last element is always **-1**.

## üîç **Example Walkthrough:**

### **Example 1:**

#### **Input:**

```plaintext
arr[] = [1, 3, 2, 4]
```

#### **Output:**

```plaintext
[3, 4, 4, -1]
```

#### **Explanation:**

- The next greater element for **1** is **3**.
- The next greater element for **3** is **4**.
- The next greater element for **2** is **4**.
- **4** has no greater element, so it is **-1**.

### **Example 2:**

#### **Input:**

```plaintext
arr[] = [6, 8, 0, 1, 3]
```

#### **Output:**

```plaintext
[8, -1, 1, 3, -1]
```

#### **Explanation:**

- The next greater element for **6** is **8**.
- The next greater element for **8** does not exist, so it is **-1**.
- The next greater element for **0** is **1**.
- The next greater element for **1** is **3**.
- **3** has no greater element, so it is **-1**.

### **Constraints:**

- $\(1 \leq \text{arr.size()} \leq 10^6\)$
- $\(0 \leq arr[i] \leq 10^9\)$

## üéØ **My Approach:**

### **Optimized Stack-Based Approach (O(N) Time, O(N) Space)**

1. **Use a stack** to efficiently find the next greater element.
2. **Iterate from right to left**, maintaining a **monotonic decreasing stack**.
3. For each element:
   - **Pop elements** from the stack that are **smaller** than the current element.
   - The **top of the stack** is the next greater element.
   - **Push the current element** onto the stack for future comparisons.

### **Algorithm Steps:**

1. Initialize an **empty stack**.
2. Traverse the array **from right to left**.
3. For each element:
   - **Pop elements from the stack** while they are **‚â§ the current element**.
   - If the stack is **empty**, the next greater element is **-1**.
   - Otherwise, the top of the stack is the **next greater element**.
   - **Push the current element onto the stack**.
4. Return the modified array.

## üïí **Time and Auxiliary Space Complexity**

- **Expected Time Complexity:** O(N), since each element is pushed and popped at most once.
- **Expected Auxiliary Space Complexity:** O(N), due to the stack storing at most N elements in the worst case.

## üìù **Solution Code**

## **Code (Java)**

```java
class Solution {
    public ArrayList<Integer> nextLargerElement(int[] arr) {
        Stack<Integer> s = new Stack<>();
        for (int i = arr.length - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
            int val = arr[i];
            while (!s.isEmpty() && s.peek() <= val) s.pop();
            arr[i] = s.isEmpty() ? -1 : s.peek();
            s.push(val);
        }
        ArrayList<Integer> res = new ArrayList<>();
        for (int num : arr) res.add(num);
        return res;
    }
}
```
