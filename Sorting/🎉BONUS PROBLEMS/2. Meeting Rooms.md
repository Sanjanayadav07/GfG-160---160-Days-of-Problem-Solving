#  _2. Meeting Rooms_ 

The problem can be found at the following link: [Problem Link](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/batch/gfg-160-problems/track/sorting-bonus-problems/problem/attend-all-meetings)

## 💡 **Problem Description:**

Given an array `arr[][]`, where `arr[i][0]` is the starting time of the i-th meeting and `arr[i][1]` is the ending time of the i-th meeting, determine if it is possible for a person to attend all the meetings. A person can only attend one meeting at a time, meaning each meeting must start after the previous one ends.

## 🔍 **Example Walkthrough:**

**Input:**

```
arr[][] = [[1, 4], [10, 15], [7, 10]]
```

**Output:**

```
true
```

**Explanation:**  
Since all the meetings are held at different times, it is possible to attend all the meetings.

**Input:**

```
arr[][] = [[2, 4], [9, 12], [6, 10]]
```

**Output:**

```
false
```

**Explanation:**  
The second and third meetings overlap, making it impossible to attend all of them.

## 🎯 **My Approach:**

1. **Sorting and Overlap Checking:**

   - First, sort the meetings based on their starting times.
   - Traverse through the sorted list, comparing the end time of the current meeting with the start time of the next meeting.
   - If any meeting starts before the previous one ends, return `false` as overlapping prevents attending all meetings.

2. **Edge Cases:**
   - If there are no meetings, return `true`.
   - If there is only one meeting, return `true` as no overlap can occur.

## 🕒 **Time and Auxiliary Space Complexity:**

- **Expected Time Complexity:** O(n log n), where `n` is the number of meetings. Sorting the list of meetings takes O(n log n), while checking overlaps requires O(n).
- **Expected Auxiliary Space Complexity:** O(1), as we only use a constant amount of additional space to store indices and temporary values.

## 📝 **Solution Code**
## Code (Java)

```java
class Solution {
    static boolean canAttend(int[][] arr) {
        Arrays.sort(arr, (a, b) -> Integer.compare(a[0], b[0]));

        for (int i = 0; i < arr.length - 1; i++) {
            if (arr[i][1] > arr[i + 1][0]) {
                return false;
            }
        }
        return true;
    }
}
```
