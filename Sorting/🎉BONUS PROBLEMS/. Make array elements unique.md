#  _4. Make array elements unique_ 

The problem can be found at the following link: [Problem Link](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/batch/gfg-160-problems/track/sorting-bonus-problems/problem/make-array-elements-unique--170645)

## 💡 **Problem Description:**

Given an integer array `arr[]`, your task is to find the **minimum number of increment operations** required to make all the array elements unique, i.e., no value in the array should occur more than once. In one operation, a value can be incremented by `1` only.

**Note:** The answer will always fit into a 32-bit integer.

## 🔍 **Example Walkthrough:**

**Input:**

```
arr[] = [3, 2, 1, 2, 1, 7]
```

**Output:**

```
6
```

**Explanation:**  
After 6 moves, the array could be `[3, 4, 1, 2, 5, 7]`. It can be shown that it is impossible for the array to have all unique values with 5 or fewer operations.

**Input:**

```
arr[] = [1, 2, 2]
```

**Output:**

```
1
```

**Explanation:**  
After one operation `[2 -> 3]`, the array could be `[1, 2, 3]`.

**Input:**

```
arr[] = [5, 4, 3, 2, 1]
```

**Output:**

```
0
```

**Explanation:**  
All elements are already unique.

### Constraints:

- $1 ≤ arr.size() ≤ 10^6$
- $0 ≤ arr[i] ≤ 10^6$

## 🎯 **My Approach:**

### Step-by-Step:

1. **Sort the Array:**  
   Sorting the array ensures that duplicates are adjacent, simplifying the process of identifying and resolving conflicts.

2. **Iterate and Adjust:**

   - Traverse the sorted array.
   - For each element, check if it is **less than or equal to the previous element**. If true:
     - Increment the element to make it **greater than the previous element**.
     - Accumulate the number of increments required in a counter (`ans`).

3. **Return the Result:**
   - After processing all elements, the value of `ans` gives the minimum number of operations needed to make all elements unique.

## 🕒 **Time and Auxiliary Space Complexity**

- **Expected Time Complexity:**

  - Sorting: O(n log n)
  - Single traversal: O(n)  
    **Overall:** O(n log n)

- **Expected Auxiliary Space Complexity:** O(1), as we only use constant extra space.

## 📝 **Solution Code**
## Code (Java)

```java
class Solution {
    public int minIncrements(int[] arr) {
        Arrays.sort(arr);
        int ans = 0;
        for (int i = 1; i < arr.length; i++) {
            if (arr[i] <= arr[i - 1]) {
                ans += arr[i - 1] + 1 - arr[i];
                arr[i] = arr[i - 1] + 1;
            }
        }
        return ans;
    }
}
```
