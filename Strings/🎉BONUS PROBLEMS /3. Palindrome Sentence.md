#  _3. Palindrome Sentence_ 

The problem can be found at the following link: [Problem Link](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/batch/gfg-160-problems/track/string-bonus-problems/problem/string-palindromic-ignoring-spaces4723)

## 💡 **Problem Description:**

Given a single string `s`, check if it is a palindrome sentence or not. A palindrome sentence is a sequence of characters that reads the same backward as forward after:

- Converting all uppercase letters to lowercase.
- Removing all non-alphanumeric characters.

## 🔍 **Example Walkthrough:**

**Input:**

```
s = "Too hot to hoot"
```

**Output:**

```
true
```

**Explanation:**  
If we remove all non-alphanumeric characters and convert all uppercase letters to lowercase, the string becomes “toohottohoot”, which is a palindrome.

**Input:**

```
s = "Abc 012..## 10cbA"
```

**Output:**

```
true
```

**Explanation:**  
After processing the string, it becomes "abc01210cba", which is a palindrome.

**Input:**

```
s = "ABC $. def01ASDF"
```

**Output:**

```
false
```

**Explanation:**  
The processed string becomes "abcdef01asdf", which is not a palindrome.

### **Constraints:**

- `1 ≤ s.size() ≤ 10^6`

## 🎯 **My Approach:**

### Step-by-Step:

1. **Pointer Initialization:**  
   Start by initializing two pointers, `i` at the start of the string and `j` at the end of the string.

2. **Skip Non-Alphanumeric Characters:**  
   Move the pointers `i` and `j` towards each other. If `s[i]` is not alphanumeric, increment `i`. Similarly, if `s[j]` is not alphanumeric, decrement `j`.

3. **Check for Matching Characters:**  
   Once valid characters are found at both pointers, convert them to lowercase and compare:

   - If they are not equal, return `false` as it is not a palindrome.
   - Otherwise, move both pointers towards the center (increment `i` and decrement `j`).

4. **End Condition:**  
   If the entire string is processed without mismatches, return `true`.

## 🕒 **Time and Auxiliary Space Complexity:**

- **Time Complexity:**  
  The algorithm performs a linear scan of the string with two pointers moving from the ends towards the center, which takes O(n) time, where `n` is the length of the string.

- **Auxiliary Space Complexity:**  
  The space complexity is O(1) as we are only using a few integer variables and no additional space proportional to the input size.

## 📝 **Solution Code**

## Code (Java)

```java
class Solution {
    public boolean sentencePalindrome(String s) {
        int i = 0, j = s.length() - 1;

        while (i < j) {
            if (!Character.isLetterOrDigit(s.charAt(i))) {
                i++;
            } else if (!Character.isLetterOrDigit(s.charAt(j))) {
                j--;
            } else {
                if (Character.toLowerCase(s.charAt(i)) != Character.toLowerCase(s.charAt(j))) {
                    return false;
                }
                i++;
                j--;
            }
        }

        return true;
    }
}
```
