#  _Day 4. Non-Repeating Character_ 

The problem can be found at the following link: [Problem Link](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/batch/gfg-160-problems/track/string-gfg-160/problem/non-repeating-character-1587115620)

## 💡 **Problem Breakdown:**

Given a string `s` consisting of lowercase Latin letters, return the first non-repeating character in `s`. If there is no non-repeating character, return `'$'`.

**Note:** When you return `'$'`, the driver code will output `-1`.

## 🔍 **Example Walkthrough:**

**Input:**  
`s = "geeksforgeeks"`  
**Output:**  
`'f'`

**Explanation:**  
In the given string, `'f'` is the first character in the string which does not repeat.



**Input:**  
`s = "racecar"`  
**Output:**  
`'e'`

**Explanation:**  
In the given string, `'e'` is the only character in the string which does not repeat.



**Input:**  
`s = "aabbccc"`  
**Output:**  
`-1`

**Explanation:**  
All the characters in the given string are repeating.



### Constraints:
- $`1 <= s.size() <= 10^5`$



## 🎯 **My Approach:**

1. **Frequency Array Method**:  
   - Since the input consists only of lowercase Latin letters, a frequency array of size `26` is sufficient to count occurrences of each character.  
   - Traverse the string once to update the frequency of each character in the array.  
   - Traverse the string a second time to identify the first character with a frequency of `1`.  

2. **Steps:**  
   - Initialize a frequency array `freq[26]` and set all elements to `0`.  
   - For each character in the string, increment its corresponding frequency in the array.  
   - Iterate through the string again, checking for the first character with a frequency of `1`.  
   - If no such character exists, return `'$'`.


## 🕒 **Time Complexity:**

- **Expected Time Complexity:** O(n), where `n` is the size of the string. The algorithm requires two linear passes through the string.  
- **Expected Auxiliary Space Complexity:** O(1), as the frequency array uses a fixed amount of additional space (`26` elements).

## 📝 **Solution Code**

## Code (Java)

```java
class Solution {
    static char nonRepeatingChar(String s) {
        int[] freq = new int[26];  
        for (char c : s.toCharArray()) {
            freq[c - 'a']++;
        }
        for (char c : s.toCharArray()) {
            if (freq[c - 'a'] == 1) {
                return c;
            }
        }
        return '$';
    }
}
```
