#  _Day 1. Minimum Platforms_ 

The problem can be found at the following link: [Question Link](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/batch/gfg-160-problems/track/greedy-gfg-160/problem/minimum-platforms-1587115620)

## üí° **Problem Description:**

You are given the arrival times `arr[]` and departure times `dep[]` of all trains that arrive at a railway station on the same day.

Your task is to determine the **minimum number of platforms** required at the station to ensure that no train is kept waiting.

At any given time, the same platform **cannot** be used for both the **arrival of one train and the departure of another**.

- If a new train arrives **before** another departs, additional platforms are required.
- If all trains are mutually exclusive in time, only **one platform** is needed.

## üîç **Example Walkthrough:**

### **Example 1:**

#### **Input:**

```
arr[] = [900, 940, 950, 1100, 1500, 1800]
dep[] = [910, 1200, 1120, 1130, 1900, 2000]
```

#### **Output:**

```
3
```

#### **Explanation:**

Between **9:40 AM to 12:00 PM**, three trains are present at the station.  
Thus, **at least 3 platforms** are needed to avoid waiting.

### **Example 2:**

#### **Input:**

```
arr[] = [900, 1235, 1100]
dep[] = [1000, 1240, 1200]
```

#### **Output:**

```
1
```

#### **Explanation:**

All train times are **mutually exclusive**.  
Thus, **only one platform** is needed.

### **Example 3:**

#### **Input:**

```
arr[] = [1000, 935, 1100]
dep[] = [1200, 1240, 1130]
```

#### **Output:**

```
3
```

#### **Explanation:**

Between **11:00 AM to 11:30 AM**, all three trains are present at the station.  
Thus, **3 platforms** are required.

### **Constraints:**

- $\(1 \leq \text{Number of trains} \leq 50,000\)$
- $\(0000 \leq \text{arr}[i] \leq \text{dep}[i] \leq 2359\)$
- **Time is given in a 24-hour format (HHMM)**.
- The **first two digits represent the hour (00 to 23)**, and the **last two digits represent the minutes (00 to 59)**.

## üéØ **My Approach:**

### **Two Pointers (Optimized Sorting)**

#### **Algorithm Steps:**

1. **Sort** both `arr[]` (arrival times) and `dep[]` (departure times).
2. Use **two pointers**:
   - `i` for arrival times, `j` for departure times.
   - **Increment `i` (new train arrives) ‚Üí Increase platform count.**
   - **Increment `j` (train departs) ‚Üí Decrease platform count.**
3. Track the **maximum platforms** needed at any time.

## üïí **Time and Auxiliary Space Complexity**

- **Expected Time Complexity:** `O(N log N)`, since sorting `arr[]` and `dep[]` dominates the time complexity.
- **Expected Auxiliary Space Complexity:** `O(1)`, as we only use a few integer variables for tracking.

## üìù **Solution Code**

## **Code (Java)**

```java
class Solution {
    static int findPlatform(int arr[], int dep[]) {
        Arrays.sort(arr);
        Arrays.sort(dep);
        int i = 0, j = 0, cnt = 0, ans = 0, n = arr.length;
        while(i < n && j < n)
            if(arr[i] <= dep[j]) { cnt++; ans = Math.max(ans, cnt); i++; }
            else { cnt--; j++; }
        return ans;
    }
}
```
