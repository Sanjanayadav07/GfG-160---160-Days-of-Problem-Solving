#  _Day 4. Solve the Sudoku_ 

The problem can be found at the following link: [Problem Link](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/batch/gfg-160-problems/track/recursion-and-backtracking-gfg-160/problem/solve-the-sudoku-1587115621)

## 💡 **Problem Description:**

Given an incomplete Sudoku configuration in terms of a 9x9 2-D interger square matrix, mat[][], the task is to solve the Sudoku. It is guaranteed that the input Sudoku will have exactly one solution.

A sudoku solution must satisfy all of the following rules:

1. Each of the digits 1-9 must occur exactly once in each row.
2. Each of the digits 1-9 must occur exactly once in each column.
3. Each of the digits 1-9 must occur exactly once in each of the 9 3x3 sub-boxes of the grid.

Note: Zeros represent blanks to be filled with numbers 1-9, while non-zero cells are fixed and cannot be changed.

## 🔍 **Example Walkthrough:**

**Input:** `mat[][] =`

**Output:**

<img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/85db2375-479d-42c9-b00c-cad83d827f43" width="40%">

**Explanation:** Each row, column and 3 x 3 box of the output matrix contains unique numbers.

**Input:** `mat[][] =`

**Output:**

<img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f4c0d26e-b082-4454-974a-fbd44f2d7540" width="40%">

**Explanation:** Each row, column and 3 x 3 box of the output matrix contains unique numbers.

### Constraints:

- `mat.size() = 9`
- `mat[i].size() = 9`
- `0 ≤ mat[i][j] ≤ 9`
- The board is always a 9×9 grid.
- Each row, column, and 3×3 sub-grid must contain digits from 1 to 9 without repetition.

## 🎯 **My Approach:**

1. **Backtracking Algorithm**:  
   The problem can be efficiently solved using a backtracking approach:

   - Identify an empty cell.
   - Try placing numbers from 1 to 9 in that cell.
   - Check if the placement is valid (no duplicates in the row, column, or 3×3 sub-grid).
   - If valid, recursively solve the rest of the board.
   - If an invalid state is encountered, backtrack and try a different number.

2. **Optimizations:**
   - Use bitwise operations (`1 << num`) to track used numbers efficiently in rows, columns, and sub-grids.
   - Reduce redundant computations by pruning early.

## 🕒 **Time and Auxiliary Space Complexity**

- **Expected Time Complexity:** O(9^(n)), where `n` is the number of empty cells. In the worst case, each empty cell can take one of nine values.
- **Expected Auxiliary Space Complexity:** O(1), as we modify the board in-place with constant extra storage.

## 📝 **Solution Code**

## Code (Java)

```java
class Solution {
    static void solveSudoku(int[][] b) {
        int[] r = new int[9], c = new int[9], box = new int[9];
        for (int i = 0; i < 9; i++)
            for (int j = 0; j < 9; j++)
                if (b[i][j] != 0) {
                    int m = 1 << b[i][j], idx = i / 3 * 3 + j / 3;
                    r[i] |= m; c[j] |= m; box[idx] |= m;
                }
        solve(b, r, c, box, 0, 0);
    }

    static boolean solve(int[][] b, int[] r, int[] c, int[] box, int i, int j) {
        if (i == 9) return true;
        if (j == 9) return solve(b, r, c, box, i + 1, 0);
        if (b[i][j] != 0) return solve(b, r, c, box, i, j + 1);
        for (int num = 1, m; num <= 9; num++) {
            m = 1 << num;
            int idx = i / 3 * 3 + j / 3;
            if ((r[i] & m) != 0 || (c[j] & m) != 0 || (box[idx] & m) != 0) continue;
            b[i][j] = num; r[i] |= m; c[j] |= m; box[idx] |= m;
            if (solve(b, r, c, box, i, j + 1)) return true;
            b[i][j] = 0; r[i] &= ~m; c[j] &= ~m; box[idx] &= ~m;
        }
        return false;
    }
}
```
